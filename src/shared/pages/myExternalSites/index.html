    <h1>My Firefox Sites</h1>
    <h2>Configure websites and pages that automatically launch in Firefox</h2>
    <p>
      Use the list below to manage the web pages you always browse with Firefox,
      and would like to open in Firefox automatically whenever you type an
      address, click a [bookmark/favorite], click on a link, or even when [name
      of browser] is launched. You can choose to launch Firefox for an entire
      website, a specific URL, or even make more complicated rules using an
      asterisk (*) as a wildcard character. For any given entry you can also
      choose whether the website or page opens in Firefox or Firefox Private
      Browsing. Note that URLs that match two entries, one which is set to open
      in Firefox Private Browsing and one which is not, will open in a private
      window.
